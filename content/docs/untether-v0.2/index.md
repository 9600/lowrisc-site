## Introduction

[lowRISC][lowRISC] is a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to
produce a fully open source System-on-Chip (SoC) in volume. We are
building upon RISC-V processor core implementations from the RISC-V
team at UC Berkeley.  We will produce a SoC design to populate a
low-cost community development board and to act as an ideal starting
point for deritivative open-source and commercial designs.

This tutorial introduces a standalone implementation of the [Rocket chip][RocketChip].
The original Rocket chip relies on a companion processor
for accessing peripheral devices and I/O. This design replaces the companion
processor with actual peripheral devices on FPGA providing an `untethered`
SoC that is able to boot a [RISC-V Linux][RISCVLinux]. A demo is provided using
the [Xilinx Kintex-7 KC705 evaluation kit]
(http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-k7-kc705-g.html). 

The tutorial also acts as an introduction to the RISC-V tools and provides
a step-by-step guide to setting up the environment necessary to run
test programs either in simulation or on an FPGA.
