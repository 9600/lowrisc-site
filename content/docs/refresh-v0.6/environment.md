lowRISC tools and source code are robust between versions of Linux, but it has been
found that
Vivado (the Xilinx FPGA implementation suite) [is particular about the O/S](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/54242.html)

All builds were completed with Vivado 2018.1. This was the newest version at the time of writing.
We have not tried every version but 2015.4 used on the previous releases does not work due to unidentified synthesis bugs in the virtual memory behaviour.
It is not known whether our previous releases can work with the latest tool installation.

For this version of Vivado the Xilinx recommended O/S 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.

It has been found that most of the problems with Vivado will go away if LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is unset after sourcing the Vivado setup. 
This is caused by obsolete versions of system libraries such as  libstc++ being incorporated into Vivado to make it more "portable".
Do not succumb to the temptation to update the system libraries inside Vivado because some of the APIs have changed.

If your machine cannot meet these requirements then synthesis should be able to run, albeit rather slowly, inside a virtual machine.
The pre-build binary images were created with Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.

Ensure you have all the necessary packages installed:

    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl \
    libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison \
    flex texinfo gperf libncurses5-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libboost-dev \
    swig git libtool libreadline-dev libelf-dev python-dev \
    microcom chrpath gawk texinfo nfs-kernel-server xinetd pseudo \
    libusb-1.0-0-dev hugo device-tree-compiler zlib1g-dev libssl-dev \
    multistrap debian-ports-archive-keyring qemu-user-static iverilog \
    openjdk-8-jdk-headless iperf3

After installing microcom you will probably want to add your username to the dialout group:

    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

This takes effect at next login. To use immediately you can use:

    sudo gpasswd dialout

followed by (your old shell settings will be forgotten):

    newgrp dialout

otherwise only the super user can make use of microcom

Next steps:

 * [Install FPGA and simulation tools]({{<ref "docs/jtag-v0.6/installtools.md">}})

You might want to add the Vivado tools to your path first to keep the environment clean. This prevents system tools
from trying to use shared libraries from the (older) Vivado install. Proceed as follows if you chose the default install
location (or follow your system adminstrator instructions)

    source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.1/settings64.sh
    unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

### Download the code

The code is hosted in the
[lowRISC chip git repository](https://github.com/lowrisc/lowrisc-chip). All
external repositories are fetched as submodules. In case you want to work on multiple branches
give each checkout a unique name (such as lowrisc-chip-jtag-v0.6)
You need to clone the proper branch (`jtag-v0.6`):

    git clone -b jtag-v0.6 --recursive https://github.com/lowrisc/lowrisc-chip.git lowrisc-chip-jtag-v0.6
    cd lowrisc-chip-jtag-v0.6

### Structure of the git repository

 * `fpga`: FPGA demo implementations
   * `board`: Demo projects for individual development boards. [[FPGA 
     Demo]]({{<ref "docs/untether-v0.2/fpga-demo.md">}})
     * `nexys4`: Files for the Nexysâ„¢4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA Board.
 * `rocket-chip`: The Rocket core and its sub-systems.
   * `riscv-tools`: The cross-compilation and simulation tool chain. [[Compile and install RISC-V cross-compiler]]({{<ref "docs/jtag-v0.6/riscv_compile.md">}})
     * `riscv-fesvr`: The front-end server that serves system calls on the host machine.
     * `riscv-gnu-toolchain`: The GNU GCC cross-compiler for RISC-V ISA.
     * `riscv-isa-sim`: The RISC-V ISA simulator [Spike](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim#risc-v-isa-simulator) [[Behavioural Simulation (Spike)]] ({{<relref "docs/untether-v0.2/spike.md">}})
     * `riscv-opcodes`: The enumeration of all RISC-V opcodes executable by the Spike simulator.
     * `riscv-pk`: The proxy kernel need for running legacy programs in the Spike simulator.
     * `riscv-tests`: Tests for the Rocket core.
 * `src`: The top level code of lowRISC chip.
   * `main`: The Verilog code for hardware implementation.
   * `test`: The Verilog/C++(DPI) test bench files

### Next steps
    
To set the correct environment variables for running lowRISC, you need to
source the script `set_env.sh` in the base directory.
This must be done in a fresh shell window, not one used to work on any other branch of LowRISC:

    source set_env.sh

It is possible to override the default values by exporting variables before sourcing the script.
The following variables are overridable:

    $TOP                Path to the lowrisc-chip directory ($PWD).
    $RISCV              Path to the riscv toolchain ($TOP/riscv).
    $OSD_ROOT           Path to the Open SoC Debug tools ($TOP/tools).
    $FPGA_BOARD         The target FPGA board (nexys4_ddr).

The remainder of this page is optional if you choose to use our pre-compiled images.

## Download and build Linux and busybox (early stage user commands)

This step is optional if you choose to use our pre-compiled images.

    sh $TOP/riscv-tools/fetch_and_patch_linux.sh

## Building the RISCV toolchain (quick start: detailed instructions are below)

    cd $TOP/riscv-tools/
    ./build.sh
    cd riscv-gnu-toolchain/build
    ../configure --prefix=$RISCV
    make -j$(nproc) linux

Or for more detail, follow these instructions _(caution: from a previous release)_ and then use the browser back button:

 * [Compile and install RISC-V cross-compiler] ({{<ref "riscv_compile.md">}})

## System on chip debug

The built-in hardware [Open SystemOnChip Debug](http://opensocdebug.org) trace debugger from previous releases is not available.
Some of its functionality (for example loading programs) is available from the GDB/openocd combination.
