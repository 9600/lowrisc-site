## Building and using the lowRISC SoC implementation

The current code release builds on the Rocket RISC-V implementation to offer
support for tagged memory (see the [release blog post](
{{< relref "blog/lowrisc-tagged-memory-preview-release.md" >}})). We've put together an
[extensive tutorial]({{< relref "docs/tutorial/index.md" >}}) on how to use this
code release as well as documenting many of the changes made.

## Memos

Our [first memo](
{{< relref "memo-2014-001-tagged-memory-and-minion-cores.md" >}}) describes our
plans for tagged memory and minion cores in lowRISC.

## Other

Student applications are now closed, but you may be interested in our [project
idea list for Google Summer of Code 2015]({{< relref "gsoc-2015-ideas.md" >}}).
