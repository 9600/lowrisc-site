## Introduction

[lowRISC][lowRISC] is a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to
produce a fully open source System-on-Chip (SoC) in volume. We are
building upon RISC-V processor core implementations from the RISC-V
team at UC Berkeley. We will produce a SoC design to populate a
low-cost community development board and to act as an ideal starting
point for derivative open-source and commercial designs.

In previous tutorials you can learn about trace debugging, 
[tagged memory][TaggedMemoryTutorial] or how to run the design on an
FPGA as an [untethered system][UntetheredTutorial].

This tutorial adds further functionality towards the final SoC design
by adding a redesigned tag pipeline, and a Minion core supporting commodity PC peripherals
such as a 4-bit SD-card control, VGA-compatible display, and USB-keyboard - bare-metal and from Linux.
The previous debug infrastructure is still available but optional for the end-user.
The build environment and pre-built images supprt the same platform as the previous releases, a low-end
[Nexysâ„¢4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA Board]
(http://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-4-ddr-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/).
