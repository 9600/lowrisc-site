**Release version 0.4** (04-2017)

## Introduction

[lowRISC][lowRISC] is a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to
produce a fully open source System-on-Chip (SoC) in volume. We are
building upon RISC-V processor core implementations from the RISC-V
team at UC Berkeley. We will produce a SoC design to populate a
low-cost community development board and to act as an ideal starting
point for derivative open-source and commercial designs.

In previous tutorials you can learn about [trace debugging][DebugTutorial],
the [initial tagged memory implementation][TaggedMemoryTutorial] or how to run
the design on an FPGA using our [original untethered
implementation][UntetheredTutorial].

This tutorial adds further functionality towards the final SoC design:

* The addition of tag cache, with further optimisations vs our previous
releases
* A tag pipeline to allow customised tag rules and for tags to be
used to enforce program invariants
* A Minion core supporting commodity PC peripherals such as a 4-bit SD-card
control, VGA-compatible display, and USB-keyboard - bare-metal and from Linux.

The previous debug infrastructure is still available but optional for the end-user.
The build environment and pre-built images supprt the same platform as the previous releases, a low-end
