## Keeping up to date

The best ways of keeping up with lowRISC developments are:

* Checking the [http://www.lowrisc.org](blog), and subscribing to the [RSS 
feed](http://www.lowrisc.org/index.xml).
* Signing up to our [announcement mailing list]({{< ref "about.md" >}}).
* Following [@lowRISC on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lowrisc).

## Mailing lists and IRC

Development discussion takes place on the lowrisc-dev mailing list. Archives 
are [here](http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.hardware.lowrisc.devel) and you 
can [subscribe 
here](http://listmaster.pepperfish.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lowrisc-dev-lists.lowrisc.org).  
There's also relevant discussion on the [RISC-V mailing 
lists](http://riscv.org/mailinglist.html).

We also have an IRC channel where a number of us as well others interested in 
lowRISC, RISC-V, and open source hardware hang out. There won't always be 
someone active, so if you have a support question you may be better off 
posting to the mailing list. Join #lowRISC on irc.oftc.net.

## Source code

You can find preview source code for lowRISC on our [GitHub organisation 
page](https://github.com/lowrisc).
