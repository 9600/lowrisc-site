  lowRISC is producing fully open hardware systems. From the processor core
  to the development board, our goal is to create a completely open computing
  eco-system.

  Our open-source SoC (System-on-a-Chip)
  designs will be based on the 64-bit [RISC-V](http://riscv.org/) instruction
  set architecture. Volume silicon manufacture is planned
  as is a low-cost development board. There are more details on our plans in 
    [these slides from a recent 
    talk](https://speakerdeck.com/asb/lowrisc-the-path-to-an-open-source-soc)

  lowRISC is a not-for-profit organisation working closely with the University
  of Cambridge and the open-source community.
