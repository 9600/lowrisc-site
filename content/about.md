  lowRISC is creating a fully open-sourced, Linux-capable, RISC-V-based
  SoC, that can be used either directly or as the basis for a custom design.

  We are [hiring](https://lowrisc.applytojob.com/) for multiple positions to
  deliver on an exciting, high impact, open source hardware roadmap in
  collaboration with Google and other industry partners.

  lowRISC is a not-for-profit organisation working closely with the University
  of Cambridge and the open-source community.

### Recent milestones

**Oct 2018**: New lowRISC [code release]({{< ref "docs/refresh-v0.6/index.md" 
>}}) upgrade Rocket to RV64GC, run/halt debug, Debian sid, performance upgrade.

**Jan 2018**: New lowRISC [code release]({{< ref "docs/ethernet-v0.5/index.md" 
>}}) focusing on the integration of open source Ethernet IP.

**May 2017**: New lowRISC [code release]({{< ref "docs/minion-v0.4/index.md" 
>}}) brings back tagged memory with builtin support in Rocket core and has a minion driven SD.

**July 2016**: New lowRISC [code release]({{< ref "docs/debug-v0.3/index.md" 
>}}) including support for trace debug.

**June 2016**: Presented a brief [tutorial at 
DAC](http://www2.dac.com/events/eventdetails.aspx?id=200-28) on prototyping 
RISC-V SoCs using lowRISC and Xilinx FPGAs.

**June 2016**: We were thrilled to be given five student slots in the 2016 
Google Summer of code. See 
[here](https://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2016/06/lowriscs-2016-google-summer-of-code-students/)
for more information about their projects.

**Dec 2015:** We have 
[untethered](https://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2015/12/untethered-lowrisc-release/)
the Rocket SoC, which now runs standalone on the KC705 and Nexys4DDR FPGAs.
This release also includes support for simulation using Verilator and is 
accompanied by [extensive documentation]({{< ref "docs/untether-v0.2/index.md" 
>}}).
